# ML-Classifiers for Face Recognition
### This Repository contains various Machine Learning Classifiers such as Bayes, K-NN, Support Vector Machines, Boosted SVMs for face recognition on a custom dataset. Codes for datat preprocessing Principal Component Analysis(PCA) and Multiple Discriminant Analysis(MDA).

---
Two classification tasks are carried out using various Machine Learning classifiers namely,

- Task 1: Subject/Label Recognition
- Task 2: Recognition of a Neutral vs an Expressive face  

The user can choose the classification task, data preprocessing method, and the classifier to perform classification from the terminal interface.  

### DATA PREPROCESSING
The data is preprocessed before it is given to a classifier for either of the tasks. Dimensionality reduction algorithms to choose from,   
- Principal Component Analysis 
- Multiple Discriminant Analysis


### TASK 1: Subject/Label Recognition 
### TASK 2: Recognition of a Neutral vs an Expressive face
